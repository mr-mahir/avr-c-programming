This is going to be a complete tutorial book on avr programming in C.

Here we will mainly learn how to write codes for avr microcontrollers.
So I will add new projects with quizzes and solutions regularly.

Initial projects will be suited for the beginners and later projects will be more advanced.

Any contribution would be appreciated.

Thank you.
